# Helpfull Info:
* I have decided to Combine all my Scripts into 1 Massive Script to make downloading Easier.
* Each Script has their Own README file so make sure you READ it so you know how to install everything.
* If you decide to make changes to anything outside of the `config.lua` i will not provide support for problems.
* I will not be doing Support for V1.3 - Unsupported.zip.
* Each Script has been tested on ESX V1.6 and wether or not it will work on any newer versions IDK.
